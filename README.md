# SECURITY-ASSIGNMENT
Implement and attack simple crypto algorithm such as: Caesar, Rail fence permutation and combine between them.

# Caesar algorithm
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.

Usage:
You can use:

```
  {python run.py -h*}
```

For more details. And there are examples command line below:

----------------------------------------------------------------
```
python run.py testcase_1_ceasar.txt 17 --decode=True

python run.py testcase_1_ceasar.txt 17 --decode=False

python run.py testcase_1_ceasar.txt 17
```
